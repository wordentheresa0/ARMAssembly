# CS 241 Hardware Design
This repository includes the code for the final project in Hardware Design.
The project is coded entirely in ARM Assembly. The project is completly terminal-based. "translator.s" is the completed project. All of the other files include code for earlier stages of the completed project.

"translator.s" will prompt the user for a sentence. Then the user will input two characters: the first one will be the character to be changed in the original sentence, the second one is what the character will be changed to in the original sentence. The program will update the sentence with the replaced character and display it to the user.
